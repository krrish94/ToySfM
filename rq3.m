% RQ3   RQ decomposition of 3x3 matrix
%
% Usage: [R,Q] = rq3(A)
%
% Argument:  A - 3 x 3 matrix
% Returns:   R - Upper triangular 3 x 3 matrix
%            Q - 3 x 3 orthonormal rotation matrix
%    Such that  R*Q = A
%
% The signs of the rows and columns of R and Q are chosen so that the diagonal
% elements of R are +ve.

% Follows algorithm given by Hartley and Zisserman 2nd Ed. A4.1 p 579
